In this lesson, students will differentiate between the two reserved methods for
controlling the main program loop.

/*
  The setup() method is a mandatory, reserved method in Processing.  This means that:
    1. It must be defined in the main program.
    2. It can only be defined once.
  The method itself is called once upon program start-up to setup the CANVAS, or the
  main displayable ENVIRONMENT of the application.
  Much of what you need to finish this assignment can be found:

void setup(){
  /*
    TODO 1:    Before modifying any code, press play and notice details about the 
               ENVIRONMENT.  When done, close the application, and write down in the 
               answer space below what you noticed.
    ANSWER:    <Start here>
  */

  /*
    INFO:      Now, we're going to start editing code in order to modify the ENVIRONMENT.
               Below, there is a line of code that has been "commented-out".  It will have
               two slashes "//" in front of it.  Comments are not for the computer; they 
               are for humans, and so upon program execution, your computer will ignore 
               them.  This means that any code you want the computer to ignore for now, just
               put // in front of it.  Likewise, you can delete the slashes to get the
               computer to see it again.
               
    TODO 2:    Remove the comment symbol in front of the code below.  Observe what happens
               to the ENVIRONMENT.
    ANSWER:    <Describe what you believe the code did.  Be specific!>

The draw() method is a mandatory, reserved method in Processing.  The method itself is 
called once every execution of the main program loop.  For example, if the main program 
executes its loop 60 times a second, the draw() function will be invoked 60 times per
second.
