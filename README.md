# Lesson 1 - Main Loop Control

This is the first of a series of lessons on programming in Java for the FIRST Robotics Competition.  It is designed for novice programmers, and can act as a precursor programming sequence to learning FRC-Java.  We will introduce:

1. Data abstraction
2. Procedure definitions
3. Procedure invocations
4. Looped behavior
5. Field scope
6. Class definitions
7. Object instantiations
8. Instance methods
9. Static methods

This will be taught under the Processing framework for easy visualization.
